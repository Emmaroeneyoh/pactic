# üí∞ Wallet Service API

This is a simple wallet service built using NestJS, Prisma, MySQL, Redis, and RabbitMQ. It supports user management , user wallet creation, funding, withdrawal, and transfers with features like concurrency control, idempotency, and asynchronous processing.

## üß† Design Decisions

- **Optimistic Concurrency Control**  
  Leveraged a `version` field in the `Wallet` table to implement optimistic locking. This ensures that concurrent deposits and withdrawals and transfers are safe, and conflicting operations are detected without relying on heavy database locks.

- **Idempotency Handling**  
  Each transaction request includes a `txId`. This ID is cached in Redis and checked before processing to ensure that repeated requests  do not result in duplicate operations.

- **Deadlock Prevention**  
  - In fund transfers, wallets are always locked in a consistent order (e.g., by ascending wallet ID) to avoid circular waits.  
  - Combined with optimistic locking, this reduces the risk of deadlocks during concurrent operations.

- **Atomic Transfers**  
  Transfers are executed within database transactions to guarantee atomicity‚Äîeither both the debit and credit occur, or none at all. The rollback mechanism ensures consistency in case of failure.

- **Message Queue Integration (RabbitMQ)**  
  - Withdrawals and transfers are processed asynchronously via RabbitMQ queues.  
  - Retry logic is implemented for transient failures, and transaction statuses are updated accordingly.

- **Caching with Redis**  
  - Frequently accessed data such as wallet balances and paginated transaction history are cached.  
  - Cache invalidation is performed immediately after changes to ensure consistency between the cache and database.

- **Soft Deletion Strategy**  
  Used a `deletedAt` timestamp to implement soft deletes for extensibility and auditability, especially for users and wallets.

- **Separation of Concerns**  
  - Modular architecture following NestJS best practices.  
  - Clear separation across domains (e.g., users, wallets, transactions, queues, cache), making the codebase maintainable and scalable.

- **Low Latency Optimization**  
  - Lightweight DTOs and minimal payloads for faster API response.  
  - Batched database reads for paginated endpoints to minimize I/O.

- **Scalability Considerations**  
  - Stateless endpoints with Redis-based shared cache.  
  - Async queue processing offloads heavy transaction logic from the HTTP layer.

- **Auditability**  
  All transactions are recorded with status tracking, timestamps, and failure metadata, allowing replay or inspection when needed.
